                                        Using AI to build websites has many advantages over traditional coding. For example, an AI-based website is capable of providing more personalized experiences for website visitors. Traditional coding requires manual effort and knowledge on coding languages, whereas using AI to create a website makes it easier to develop, customize and deploy a website in much less time with minimal effort and design decisions. Additionally, by utilizing AI models, businesses can use machine learning to modify their websites in order to deliver better suited content or products, as well as gain insights into visitor preferences and behavior patterns. Finally, AI technology can be used to automate web analysis tasks such as creating predictive user profiles or detecting anomalies in real-time data streams. This type of automation allows businesses to be agile and quickly adjust their strategy according to current market conditions or user needs.
